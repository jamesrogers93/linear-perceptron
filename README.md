# Machine Learning - Linear Perceptron

My machine learning coursework submitted at the University of East Anglia.

The goal of this project was to correctly classify datasets using the linear perceptron machine learning algorithm.

This project incorporates:
  - Online & Offline learning update rules
  - Cross Validation
  - Ensemble


## Installation

The project should run without any configuration changes.
